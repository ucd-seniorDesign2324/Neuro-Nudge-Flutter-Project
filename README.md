Autonomous Time Blocking Task Scheduler

## Description

The application integrates with Google Calendar to sync existing commitments like classes and appointments, then retrieves students' tasks and deadlines. It automatically sorts tasks by priority, considering factors like due dates, task length, and importance, and identifies empty time slots in the calendar. Using time blocking, it schedules tasks in available slots based on their urgency, helping students, especially those with ADHD, focus and stay organized. The app sends reminders for tasks and adjusts dynamically when new tasks are added. Additionally, it categorizes tasks and uses machine learning to personalize and optimize the schedule based on user habits and productivity.
